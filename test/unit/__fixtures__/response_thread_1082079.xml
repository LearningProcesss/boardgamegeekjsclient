			<body>Is it about time we start talking about the ridiculous thing &quot;TSR&quot; is doing?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So what happened is a Gygax brother let the trademark lapse on the TSR brand and it was immediately snatched up by people who run a local 'game museum' (I'm honestly not sure if this is much more than a hobby shop that specializes in collectable out of print stuff).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They announced that they planned to reprint some old RPG materials that Wizards of the Coast currently owns and sells in PDF form. Naturally Wizards sent them a C&amp;D about that.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, they have decided that they want to bring a libel lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast on the grounds that Wizards of the Coast has said that Wizards does not approve of some problematic things in older D&amp;D books. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Remember, TSR has nothing at all to do with those D&amp;D books, they are just random dudes who bought the trademark.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They've started an indiegogo with a flex goal, filed a legal claim, dropped it and vowed that they'll file another one, and thrown some minor tantrums in the comments section.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/support-tsr-against-wizards-of-the-coast#/discussion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;postlink&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer noopener&quot;&gt;Support TSR against Wizards of the Coast&lt;/a&gt;</body>

TSR Hobbies knew that the products owned by WotC have TSR branding on them.  When WotC talks about the products WotC owns, TSR Hobbies can't suddenly claim that WotC is causing brand confusion.  It would be like me calling my son Napoleon Bonaparte and then claiming damage is being done to my son when people speak ill of the dead Frenchman.  I knew the confusion would happen &lt;i&gt;because I caused the confusion.&lt;/i&gt;</body>

They're trying to create Fox-News style outrage: saying anything was amiss with D&amp;D books from the 1970s is an insult to D&amp;D fans and you should all be mad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find it noteworthy that they already dropped their first case and that the excess money that they raise in their crowdfunding will go to building up their museum business. Their case does not have to hold any water for them to profit thereby.</body>

As for motivation, I suspect you're giving too much credit to the new new TSR here, their very existence isn't exactly a model of good faith.  You missed out the possibility that:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- They never intended anything other than to drop the campaign and keep the money, making some free cash and a few headlines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I mean, there really isn't much for them to lose here is there?  Its not like they've ever had a great deal of credibility anyway.</body>

			<body>I'd be very interested in seeing what youtube copyright attorney Leonard French would say about this TSR case. He's covered a few dodgy copyright/IP cases, most recently one on a game dev claiming kalashnikov stole their gun ideas.</body>
