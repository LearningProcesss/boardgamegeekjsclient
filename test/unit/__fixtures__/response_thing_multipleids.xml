						               													<description>From the publisher:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;Nasty ticks in big burgers&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Tasty hamburger ingredients are placed on the table. Each player gets four ingredients on his hand and tries to build delicious burgers which get high scores. But hey, what's that? There's a tick between the ingredients. Try to get rid of it as fast as possible. Put it in a burger and hope that no one notices. Fortunately you also can put it in an opponent's burger. But he may give you his burger then and you mustn't refuse that nice 'gift'.&amp;#10;Bluff: Place your ingredients face-down on the table. So no one knows if it's cheese, salad, onions or a little tick. When your opponent gives you that burger, you'll get extra-score. Find the right strategy and the right face-expression to convince your opponents. When the cards are turned face-up, it's getting funny. Tick-Burger is a funny mixture of strategy, chance and bluff for the whole family.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

						               													<description>Gather your band of heroes and journey to Realms of Terrinoth in Legacy of Dragonholt!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The first game to use the Oracle system, Legacy of Dragonholt captures the spirit of a roleplaying game without needing a game master. This narrative game for one to six players allows players to build their own unique hero and embark on six noble quests. Battle goblins, foil the plot of an evil lord, and add a new story to your tale!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Prepare for Adventure&amp;#10;Legacy of Dragonholt is a narrative adventure game that creates a unique experience by blending aspects of roleplaying and adventure games, open world concept video games, and even Choose Your Own Adventure books. Unlike many games, Legacy of Dragonholt is not about winning or losing, but rather about the act of creating a story. Without the need for a Game Master, this game ensures that every player has the opportunity to shape how their adventure plays out while its intuitive gameplay means that you waste little time before jumping into your tale.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Before you first set out on your adventure, you must confront one of the most difficult questions in gaming: who will you become? Legacy of Dragonholt gives you the opportunity to play as one of six humanoid races that reside in Terrinoth: humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, gnomes, and catfolk. Next, you'll select a class, before defining your physical and personality traits, and scribing a personal history. Each of these features creates a multifaceted character and defines the types of traits you possess, which in turn affect how you will approach obstacles throughout your journey and how you'll contribute to your party. For an in-depth look at the character creation process, you may look at our previous article here. Once you've created your own unique character, you're ready to dive in to a narrative adventure unlike any you&amp;rsquo;ve seen before.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Explore The Realm&amp;#10;Once your journey begins, Legacy of Dragonholt combines two forms of gameplay between the comprehensive Village Book and the six quest books that provide the plotlines of your tales. Within Dragonholt Village, you will encounter many colorful characters, each with their own stories that progress and interweave regardless of your involvement. The world is yours to explore, but it is not yours to control. Like a real community, the places you can explore vary depending on when you visit, and your encounters with the locals change depending on your traits and past experiences. For instance, a bakery may only be open early in the day, and the baker themselves may take a shine to you if you&amp;rsquo;ve already met their cousin, or if they&amp;rsquo;ve heard of the great deeds you&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished earlier in your stay in the village. Outside the relative safety of the village, thrilling dangers and mysteries await that you can experience in six unique quests. You will investigate strange happenings within in the village and venture into the wilds beyond to journey through deep woods, delve into dark crypts, and confront creatures long thought dead. As you progress throughout the game you will find that, like your village experience, your quests also change based on your past experience, who you have or have not met, and how much time has passed. After all, if you learn that someone is in peril to the west of Dragonholt Village, they are not likely to wait patiently for three days while you explore in the east. Your actions have consequences, but ultimately the choice lies with you. You do not have to be a hero. This is your story, and it is yours to define.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;mdash;description from the publisher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>

			<comment username="4ndrewcol3" rating="7" value="I love the idea of a game that is mostly story with choices for the characters to make.  The writing is good, but could have been great with more editing and work.

Update: After more plays I&apos;m getting into the story and am enjoying myself very much." />
			<comment username="79strat" rating="6" value="This was oddly hard to get into for me, especially the character creation. I had a really hard time &quot;teaching&quot; this one as the only real way it seemed for someone to learn is to read the whole character creation book themselves, or read it to them, which sucks. So we finally just read the whole thing together out loud and I made up a hero I guess (no imagination hence I don&apos;t RPG) and we did the introduction scenario, which was rather boring as I didn&apos;t particularly care about either of the NPCs leading us through the woods. I&apos;m assuming it will pick up as time goes on." />

			<comment username="acorns2009" rating="8.5" value="Definitely the best storytelling I&apos;ve encountered in a while. The NPC&apos;s are well-thought out characters with unique personalities that reflect well in the writing. The day-to-day life in the city of Dragonholt isn&apos;t the same depending on what areas or shops you visit and the time of day you visit them. Depending on how well you do in the city and your adventures may alter the story line. 

As an individual who grew up in a very conservative home, the only part I personally didn&apos;t like is the two supporting cast NPC&apos;s are lesbian and have their own part in the story. The two characters are lightly flirty (no graphic details, but implied meanings) and may you attend their wedding as an option.

This isn&apos;t a combat-heavy book as there are only a few adventures (books) outside the city of Dragonholt, but they provide enough adventure for me to feel satisfied.

			<comment username="ajewo" rating="N/A" value="Perfect game to introduce people to role playing games. Each player generates his own character with an individual background story. The story has countless branches. A brilliant thing is, that to.e matters, so that player cannot do everything, they have to make decisions what they want to do but it may be too late then for a particular opportunity. Moreover, each player can once do a decision although it is not within his skill set by flipping a coin token. After that he can do it again when all other players have flipped there coin. This system leads to interesting decision making.
The game has a lot of text, it plays in a utopian fantasy world, and social passages happen more often than action scenes or fights.
Replayability is rather low, maximal two playthroughs" />

			<comment username="albcann" rating="7" value="Very well written, lots of work went into this and considering the voluminous material, I detected no typos so the proofreaders were spot on.  The story was good, tense at times and much more immersive than the typical &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot; books that the game is compared to.  

My complaints
(1) It moved along slowly at times.  To some, that might be a positive because it made the story seem more real, not adventure after adventure. But I found those parts a little boring.  

(2) This one is tough to articulate.  The game seemed a little over the top regarding 2017 themes.  There is a lesbian marriage and a transgender character.  Not sure that is necessary in a fantasy setting, but then again, those are prominent issues currently.  However, I felt this was a little too overt for my tastes.  As a result, I am hesitant to pass the game on to my brother and his 5th grade daughter who were looking forward to borrowing the game when I finished.  

Nonetheless, the game is a positive experience and I think worth the $45 to pick it up.  You probably could replay it a couple of times with different characters to try and see everything, but the replayability is not a selling point here.  " />

			<comment username="amiller01" rating="7" value="It&apos;s a low/no-difficulty self-guided story that doesn&apos;t focus so much on your character vs. those around you.

			<comment username="Anasthy" rating="8" value="This is a fantastically crafted adventure story book (which I enjoy). If you&apos;re expecting a board game I would skip. 

Very well written with a high fantasy theme. I enjoy jumping around the books and it feels seamless. The character creation is easy and relates great to a tabletop lingo. The cards are suppose to give a board game feel. I play without them as I imagine most roleplayers would (people familiar to managing a large character sheet with many options).

There are no dice, only options to select that play out in narrative. I enjoy other adventure games that have a dice mechanic, a lot of items to get bonus or abilities to introduce new options (like passive abilities). Also rolling against then story for skill checks or fighting monsters.

Can be played with up to six &quot;readers&quot;. I&apos;m reading through solo with a single character- works great." />
			<comment username="ande9249" rating="9" value="The experience and game engine is wonderful. But there is one mis-step I would call out here. This box would have been better served by have 20+ pre-made characters that people could select from and run through the game with. Possibly refining the talents and stamina around. The main problem is my group did a great job developing unique backgrounds and characters, but it feels like we are coloring outside the lines. The options we would take in a full RPG just aren&apos;t being presented in the story. While 80% of the time it is working fine, and the story is good and driving along at a good pace, the other 20% of the time we are talking over the reader of the story, stating that we are doing this or that instead. Now this probably means that my group is ready to move onto a full RPG instead, but this product just isn&apos;t a perfect fit. 

That said for those who don&apos;t have experience with an RPG this product is a great way to play a game &quot;on rails&quot; just a little bit. But that audience would want that stack of pre-made characters to choose from anyways...just a mis step to not have them." />

This is discussed on the forums, but there are things to know going in, if playing with kids, especially a somewhat surprising and upsetting outcome.

My 6yo&apos;s notes in quotes.

Interesting Decisions: 3/5
&quot;The decisions are interesting, but not as much as Santorini. Maybe 7 out of 10. &quot;

Fun: 5/5
&quot;It&apos;s really fun. That&apos;s what it&apos;s best at. Maybe 10 out of 10.&quot;

Flow: 5/5
&quot;I do like to keep playing a lot. Maybe a 10.&quot;

Interactivity: 3/5

Tail: 4/5
&quot;We know most of the story. If we did other things it might do other things. It&apos;s maybe an 8 cause it&apos;s pretty long, but some other games might be longer than it.&quot;

Presentation: 5/5
&quot;Maybe I think that&apos;s a 9. The story is pretty good. That&apos;s not what it&apos;s best at though, it&apos;s best at being fun.&quot;

Overall: 8.3/10" />
			<comment username="anyregularnamewilldo" rating="10" value="Very high production value. Due to Corona, I&apos;m running two groups for this over Discord, acting as the bookkeeper/narrator, while also playing a solo campaign. It&apos;s fun to see the groups take different paths through the story and having everyone roleplay their character a little bit. Small tip: If you use the character names and pronouns while reading the entries, that really adds to the immersion.

This is really an 8 for me, first time I&apos;m choosing to counter-rate a game, due to the ridiculously backwards people giving it a 1 (without having played it) because they&apos;re afraid of lesbians. Leave your swamp sometime if you feel compelled to reviewbomb a title for having &quot;modern social agendas&quot;. Orcs, magic and dragons are okay, but I guess if the story is not about a bunch of straight cis dudes rescuing damsels in distress, then that&apos;s just a step too far.

It&apos;s quite ridiculous that the community needs to correct ratings like this. Wish there was a report system for these trolls." />

Had the game decided to focus on weaving together pieces of an entertaining story, rather than driving its errant agenda, it may have been more compelling. Even so, the system is capped at &apos;boring&apos; no matter what the setting is, due to its simplistic stats and obvious choice points. 

In short, it&apos;s an empty, soulless walk down depravity lane." />

			<comment username="bcnevan" rating="2" value="Legacy of Dragonholt (LoD) is a failure of a choose-your-own-adventure  game. The writing spells out everything with such directness that there&apos;s little mystery, little sense of danger, and basically zero difficult narrative choice. With a dire lack of mystery, only the non-player characters provide a hook for the player to engage with the experience. And, in view of the atomization required by its hard-coded paragraph format, those hooks are dulled. 

LoD is a failure of an RPG. The story makes so many assumptions about the player-created characters and how they want to interact with the world. (If I squint, there&apos;s a part of me that feels as if the volume of assumptions is intentional and may even be the point; but they needed to lean in harder if they meant for that sort of meta-commentary to be impactful.) Further, the text manages to provide little sense of history or that you are occupying a lived-in world. The story is told at you, and the player characters&apos; skills provide only a small diffraction from what the authors intend to tell you. There&apos;s no role playing here, just reading. This failure as an RPG is emphasized in neon yellow highlighting and furious underlining since I played multiple sessions of Thousand Year Old Vampire just before trying this title. Thousand Year Old Vampire is rich in theme, history, creativity, and actual role-playing. In comparison, it becomes clear that LoD removes the dynamic creativity of the game master from the RPG experience; but also maintains most of the admin needed to track story progression. In essence, LoD manages to excise the dynamic narrative benefits of an RPG, while capturing the administrative burdens. 

LoD is a failure of a puzzle game. The small moments where the game asks for some deduction and/or puzzle solving are so basic as they may as well not be there. It&apos;s trivial nonsense that also makes playing multiplayer more cumbersome.

Most of the above failures are exacerbated by the limitations of LoD&apos;s physical implementation. A large part of the game is abstractly traversing two hubs. The first hub is the town of Dragonholt and its location-sparse map. The second hub is the paragraph book and its constant page shuffling. LoD manages to take what might be one act of an excellent RPG video game and stretch it over an exhaustive amount of page turning and map perusal. The first time you go through the paragraph book&apos;s version of a customer service shortcut menu so you can ask an NPC about another NPC, you will scream for automation. 

This game would be a passable narrative-based video game. Nothing would be lost in either the solo experience or the multi-player experience if this game was converted to a purely digital experience. In fact, the experience could only be improved. The narrative bits would incorporate past choices more smoothly. Needless admin would be lessened and not hang like an anchor in view of the number of decisions you make in the game. Even the best aspect of the game, the time passing mechanism, would be simply automated by a digital product. Choosing the right medium for your experience is important. Unfortunately, LoD actively chooses not to." />

			<comment username="Ben_Bos" rating="7.5" value="For someone like me who considers gaming a matter of dreaming away instead of &quot;winning&quot; a game, this of course is a great experience.
I tried a few times a &quot;read through adventure&quot; book before, but this is simply better.

I don&apos;t know why exactly. Perhaps it is the lack of dice or the writing, but this FFG &quot;game&quot; is indeed better.
The creation of your character is already great with many more skills to choose from. But this gem succeeds in convincing me I actually walk in a world of adventure.

I guess the competitive euro gamer will not like it much. There is no &quot;win&quot; as such, nor is there a competition through planting vegetables or tiles.
The game system though is for those who love RPG&apos;s and dream away in their adventure games. It is very straight though, no Magic Realm magic...
As such it succeeds where sometimes more traditional games often fall short: story telling and mood setting. 
I can only hope this system will be expanded upon as it could be transferred to Mystery murder solving or HP Lovecraft spooky tales.

Replayability. I think yes there is at least room for 2 adventures through the whole series with complete different characters. And I think that after 3-4 years you could enjoy one or two more rides. Like in Ambush series.

It certainly helps when you would add a group to an adventure you already ran through and without revealing things, you could have really FUN with repeated plays.

With 15-20hours per box and going to 2 seperate playing sessions over the year, I think you will have 30-40 hours of fun with this box. That&apos;s more than an average video game will give you as STORY telling is concerned.

TLDR: Buy it if you wanted a RPG to play solo or with the wife.
Avoid it at all costs if you are a competitive gamer with euro play in mind." />

			<comment username="Bigtop305" rating="9" value="This deserves a nine more than most nines in my collection I think. There is SO much well done game here, from the immersive story, to the innovative time mechanic, to puzzles GALORE that don&apos;t ruin the game if you miss them. The package is so complete! while there is a ton here, it is truly tragic to think that this system will not be used in other product lines or see Dragonholt itself deepened. Still there is a lot in this box, it is beyond worth the asking price in my opinion with the supplementary locations and books also brilliantly produced. This game lays brilliant for one as much as a party, and re-playability has so far not taken a hit for me playing solo then with others back through the same content with different choices. You pick your character, you have some light character building, then off you go on an adventure that is meaty, and eventful. Choose your path and wind your way through the world, but don&apos;t look too deeply in the box when you get it, as player aids, themed and timed for the play-through await you to flesh out the role playing. you just need paper, pencil your own imagination is optional but helps and then sit back and go on a wild ride that is well worth it!" />

			<comment username="BirdfluNuggetz" rating="7" value="Basically, a huge “Choose your own way” novel with some character stat maintenance.  Mild inventory tracking, skills, events.  If you like that sort of thing (I loved it as a kid), it’s a nice revisit.  Quality story, wish it has a bit more flexibility and options for healing and refreshing skills (I had one particularly nasty battle, and it inactivated 5 skills, I had no way to recover even 30% before endgame). 

Recommended for the solo crowd, not sure about multiple players." />

In the adventure on Day 6 it felt like we weren&apos;t allowed to make the choice we wanted and most of the &quot;choices&quot; were if you have this skill go here/if you don&apos;t go here. That&apos;s not a choice! We completed the adventure and then were faced with spending more time in the village wandering aimlessly and having tedious conversations. Clearly this was not the game for us. We don&apos;t play rpgs and I don&apos;t like fantasy so we decided to move on from this game without completing the campaign." />
			<comment username="booned" rating="6" value="Hurm. So I like the idea of the game, I like a lot of CYOA-style board games. As a game, it works, it&apos;s well written and a lot of thought was given to game mechanisms, instead of it just being a narrative adventure, which I appreciate.

As noted, the game is quite inclusive, and goes against traditional character types by having lots of female fighters, for example. I suppose some people could find parts of the writing a bit heavy-handed. Extremely minor spoiler: There&apos;s a character who&apos;s a princess, I guess, and her dad wants her to marry a prince, but she wants to go off and adventure. And she almost literally, at one point, says, &quot;And what if I want to marry a princess instead? What about THAT, Dad? Eh? What do you say to THAT?&quot; Fine sentiment, but it&apos;s wielded clumsily, like trying to fight armed with a 2x4. (The rest of the writing is very, very good.)

I have a complaint, and I guess it&apos;s a small one but it really impacts my enjoyment of the game.

The game will give you options regarding your skills: If you have archery, you can choose to shoot an arrow. Great so far.
In a multiplayer game (I play 2p with my son), one player makes a choice, then all the consequences happen to that one player (stamina lost, etc.) until the next decision point comes along. Okay, makes sense. It&apos;s a little awkward but it works.
But it&apos;s become a joke in our game that every time I try to use my archery skill, I succeed at shooting my arrow, and the story continues... and then it asks me if I have another, completely unrelated skill. You can only have a small number of skills, so you&apos;re not likely to have what it asks for. While I have archery, I don&apos;t have both archery and devotion, or don&apos;t have archery and streetwise, or archery and brawling. So I succeed in my arrow shot, then I take a massive amount of damage because I&apos;m unable to avoid the next thing, which requires a completely different skill set.

This is exacerbated by the fact that, as you lose health/stamina, you eventually lose skills. And healing stamina doesn&apos;t automatically bring those skills back. I started the game with something like six or eight skills, and now I have one, because I took so much damage that I lost skills. I get a small number (2?) back with rest, which is much too few, and makes it more likely I will be unable to perform the next test and so will take more damage. The weak get weaker.

Before playing your first game, I&apos;d strongly recommend a house rule: Sleeping for the night restores all of your skills." />

It is not exactly a game. More a book, but so nice. 
Más bien es un escoge tu propia aventura de toda la vida vitaminado" />

Everything from the creation of the character to the beautifully written story is done with passion.
The Oracle system that drives the game is very good and you feel like playing a session of Dungeons and Dragons or other Pen and Paper Role Playing Game without a Game Master, dices or complicated rules." />

It&apos;s a variation of choose-your-own-adventure." />
			<comment username="bsacks" rating="9" value="Now half-way through my second full game (both solo), I am LOVING this game (whether or not it is technically a &quot;game&quot; or more of an interactive story). The story is incredibly immersive and really makes me feel the emotions of my character. I love the mix of goal-oriented quests and the more open-ended exploration of town. This has been a great escape for me during this time when we&apos;re all trapped at home. I can pick this up for just a few minutes or a few hours at a time, and enjoy my time either way." />
			<comment username="btasam" rating="7" value="Despite resting more on narrative-choice than role playing, LoD offers an immersive experience that&apos;s layered with moments of intrigue and exploration. The character creation is well executed and subsequent plays require no set up or prep time. Even the prologue was quite enjoyable for an opening encounter. 

LoD&apos;s ability to create and sustain a realistic society continues to be one of its greatest strengths. As an example, visiting a location on a certain day but also at a certain time of day can generate unique outcomes.

After more plays, exploring the city of Dragonholt has started to feel tedious, but even worse, I&apos;m beginning lose faith in any narrative direction. Part of this is due to the growing number of loose ends in the plot. I really hope I&apos;m wrong and that some convergence is on the horizon." />
			<comment username="Burnham" rating="10" value="This is not a book. It also doesn’t scratch my itch to play a boardgame. But it is some of the most fun I’ve ever had “doing something!”

-It’s true that there’s not really any game mechanics but it’s a really clever system.
-The town feels alive and you become emotionally invested in the characters.
-Obviously this isn’t SUPER replayable, but I am looking forward to my next playing of it and I just completed the campaign about an hour ago.
-Granted I’m playing it solo (and it works great that way), I would really enjoy it playing with other people too.
-CANON QUEER CHARACTERS! I wish this were so common in games that it didn’t need to be pointed out when it occurs, but unfortunately it’s still a rarity. Thank you Nikki Valens!

It really does feel like an rpg and I can’t wait for a sequel!" />

			<comment username="camidon" rating="9" value="What a nice surprise. An expanded choose your own adventure.  A great evening story game with light decisions. When I’m exhausted after work, this one still is easy to play and enjoy. As a writer, I find the story interesting, if somewhat expected, and well written. I quite like the time you spend in town, which rounds out the adventures nicely.  Few complaints. You don’t get much in the box for the price, but clearly a lot of development went to the branching storylines. Couldn’t we have gotten some copies of the tracking sheets.  Really? We have to copy this stuff? Occasionally there’s a disconnect between story events where opponents visit other places, and the the story assumes you know what happened while you were doing other things.  Overall, a hit. I’d purchase more like this, especially if they come out with a story better suited to play with my kids." />
			<comment username="Cancelled" rating="6.5" value="Not sure yet, as we aren&apos;t done, but so far my impressions through most of the game are: great gameplay evolution on Consulting detective, innovative storytelling mechanisms meets DnD light, and unfortunately a very unbalanced and ramble-y pace through much of the game. This games highs are high, but you can wander around reading stuff that you feel like the game wants you to read... only to realize it is pointless, generic fantasy drivel. Mad points for building a story that is very inclusive to all kinds of characters, especially LGBTQ ones (even if that inclusion can be a bit heavy handed at times). A marvelous piece of Art that I am enjoying seeing through to the end, but is a little more duty than mad excitement at this point. It is really fun to real along with the characters (even the combat is fun!), but so far feels like the pace of the story varies too wildly for it to be continually engaging throughout.

Edit: Sadly traded away before we even finished it. The story dragged and dragged and finally we weren&apos;t even compelled to finish the big finale. I wish the story had done more to consistently hook you in for another session, rather than have such wild variations in pace." />

			<comment username="cbrua" rating="7" value="A giant solo adventure that brought me happy memories of playing Tunnels &amp; Trolls as a kid.  It is well written with vivid descriptions and characters that have distinctive personalities.  The story point system is an excellent way of &quot;remembering&quot; past events so that they impact the story, and the skill system was a lot quicker than rolling a bunch of dice.  Fun, but it&apos;s still a $60 game that you will only play once.  The LGBT content was a bit off-putting for me and seemed a bit forced into the story.  

I enjoyed the game overall and recommend it if you like the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style of books." />
			<comment username="cbs42" rating="8" value="The game group had a fun time with it. In the first session we did the intro book, then puttered around Dragonholt city for a bit, then ran through the &quot;Slivers of Silver&quot; quest. I do wish there was more &quot;game&quot; in this game though. As entertaining and different as it was, it really just felt like a group Choose Your Own Adventure session. There are no randomizers of any kind, so no dice rolling or card play. I wish it did include just a little more mechanical depth, but the storyline has been very entertaining." />

The system is quite clever (building up new skills, story points and time passing) but the story has been slow and I find the setting to be unbelievable e.g. A new plate glass window for the pharmacy? Where from exactly? And why cart broken bits of furniture to a town dump when they could be broken up to heat a house? There&apos;s a lot of reading aloud (if you are not playing solo), not many decisions per adventure and no feeling of peril." />
